Imagine you just got hired at a company as a full stack software engineer. Their tech stack is composed of React and Python. You never wrote a single line of Python code, but you have some backend experience from side projects.

On day one you are thinking...

> Will I be able to learn a new programming language? Is my previous knowledge enough? My impostor syndrome is crying out.

Impostor syndrome is the act of feeling like an outsider or a fake in your industry. The fear of getting called out as not being full stack and the fear of not being able to meet the expectations of my team were real thoughts going through my head.

You may or may not be aware of this phenomenon when it actually happens to you. In my case, I was aware but unable to handle it in the best way at first. In my first few weeks, I avoided any work that involved dealing with Python code.

It is difficult to learn anything new, and in my case I was also not passionate:

> I know JavaScript, and can use it across the entire stack. What value will learning Python ever provide me?

It's a very selfish thought. By being stubborn about what I choose to learn, I provide less value as a contributor to the company's software and products.

## Experience aids growth

My problem was a lack of experience in backend architecture and learning new languages. As I embarked on this new journey, I feared how it would turn out.

However with time and the help of my peers, I became familiar with the codebase, language syntax, conventions, etc. Learning one thing spiraled into learning another.
